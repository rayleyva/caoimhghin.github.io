<p>During a review of our email campaigns recently our marketing team talked a lot about how we need to choose a ESP to handle our marketing emails instead of sending them in-house. The arguments generally followed along the lines of more data, more analytics, more options, more features, lots of more more more. It was mind blowing just to hear about the different data points that some ESPs provide.<br></p>
<br>
Even though our in-house email system doesn't have all the bells and whistles, it does give some basic metrics:<br><ol>
<li>Number of emails delivered</li>
<li>Number of bounces</li>
<li>Number of opens</li>
<li>Number of clicks</li>
</ol>

Nothing is graphed over time telling the hour, minute, and second each email was opened, and during that same time the number of clicks versus opens, etcâ€¦ We don't track behavior of specific users over time, who opens often, who never opens, none of that.<br><br>
This is basic, actionable data. Meaning there is a simple process that I can repeat to improve the email campaign based on this data alone. I can take action against this data without question, measure and repeat.<br><ol>
<li>Act</li>
<li>Measure</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ol><i>If the number of clicks is too low, change the title of the campaign to something more compelling to my audience.</i><br><br><i>If the number of clicks is too high, throw a party.</i><br><br>
Some data is just interesting. In a recent email campaign that I sent through MailChimp I learned all of the above data points plus some interesting things like 2.3% of the emails were opened in Japan, 0.6% were opened in Germany, and the last one to be opened was at 8:53 AM. All of those things leave me with this really nice <i>WOW</i>&nbsp;feeling, but I'm not quite sure what to do with that information. Should I be confused because all of my customers and subscribers initially had products shipped to them only inside the US, yet 2.6% were opened from Japan? Do I care?
