## "Because of the self-confidence with which he had spoken, no one could tell whether what he said was very clever or very stupid."
â€• Leo Tolstoy

Interviewing is tough on both ends of the interview, but for sure, for the candidate. You're willingly entering into a situation
where you are being judged for fitness for a particular position on a particular team. Usually, you're going into the interview
already wanting to join the team, or company in question so you've already judged them to be a good fit for you, now you're
being judged.

The stakes are high for your personal identity. You'll be rejected or accepted based on how well you do during the interview. You're
being tested. Do you know what you're talking about? Do you lie on your resume? Are you cool? Are you interesting? **Are you good enough?**

For technical interviews, it gets even harder. We always do live coding sessions. As if answering some simple questions
about technology, your past, your work history, and your hobbies isn't personal enough; we ask you to really open up and show
us how you write code. The most personal thing ever. Writing code is an extremely personal form of self expression and
the mere thought of having someone watch the thoughts come out of your head can be paralyzing.

*It is harder than hitting on a complete stranger in a bar!*

After conducting interviews for several years, I've noticed the one thing that really separates people very quickly, so fast,
that it could happen before the interview even starts. You're confident; or you're not.

What are the things that set off this confidence trigger?

Here are some positive ones. These are just the kinds of things that confident people say or do and they probably don't always
jump out at the interviewer, but these things have a big impact on them regardless.

1. Fail quick and brush it off. You don't have to be arrogant about it, in fact this is probably manifested as a very quick remark
that you make while you're trying to solve a problem. A confident person that is stuck will say "I'm stuck". It really is that
simple. We intentionally get you to this point. We will continue asking questions until this happens or we run out of time,
whichever comes first. Some people do know everything, and we run out of time. If that's you then great, go throw a party. For the rest
of us, just roll with it. Don't freeze up and forget your name.

2. Express yourself early. There are simple things that you say to your friends, acknowledgements, or whatever. If you're
confident and comfortable then those things will naturally come out. Expressing some of those familiar actions or phrases
also helps you to loosen up and just be yourself. Doing that makes you naturally more confident.

3. Have questions of your own. If you don't have anything to ask then you don't care about where you're going to spend
a very large portion of your life and who you're going to spend it with. What team wants this person?

4. If you don't get the joke, don't laugh. You might be the most fabulous BSer on the planet, just don't do it. Often this
happens when you go off and start talking so much you forgot what you were talking about and you start to exaggerate, or
you want to sound cooler than you think you do. Just don't do it, there's no need. Remember, don't make things harder
by pre-judging yourself, just go be yourself.

Sometimes you're flat out bombing the interview, but nobody actually cares. Why don't they care? Because of who you are. You
made them like you by simply participating in the interview as you. Until you crack. The number one killer of all killers
is giving up.

**Never Give Up**

Don't make the interview harder by judging yourself, there are already plenty of people judging you. So shut off the voice in
your head and keep going. Keep being you. Express yourself however you do and you'll kill the interview. Even if you don't get
the position or move forward, you still killed it. Why? Because you also don't want to put yourself in a bad position and
because you put yourself out there... as you... then you can be confident that if they're not moving forward, they're
doing the best thing for both you and them.

**You killed it.**
