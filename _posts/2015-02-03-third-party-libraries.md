## "Why write code yourself that someone else has already written to perfection?"
<br/>

* *On the shoulders of giants*
* *Leverage other people's code*
* *Reusable components*
* *Web services*
* *Composable services and service orchestration*
* *Open source frameworks*

<br/>

The typical web application today is probably composed of some 30+ third party libraries expressed in one form or
another. And that's really on the surface. If you dig deep and depending on how you define the reusable components,
you're probably talking in the hundreds.

What makes these components so great, and why this development paradigm is so awesome is that we can depend on these
libraries to **just work**. We use them out of the box with very little thought as to how well they will work in our
real world environment. We don't really spend much time testing these parts of our system.

### What happens when things don't **just work**?

What about when newer, better versions of these libraries come out? How do you test compatibility, security, performance,
and reliability of the new components and then choose to make any necessary changes and finally upgrade?

### If you don't upgrade, you get left behind.

And progress is being made at an ever increasingly rapid pace.

Why try to keep up with this yourself? Instead, <a href="/services/">hire me</a>. This is what I do.
