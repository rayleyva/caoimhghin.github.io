title:  "Fractional Energy, Startups, Hold, Fold, All In"

I was in a meeting recently where I asked this question: Given that we want to spend a fraction of our energy on 
new products and services, at what point in the evolution of those services do you decide that they have turned into 
quick sand; slowly absorbing small fractions of our energy over long periods of time?

## Fractions

I believe in doing many different things and you can't do many different things without dividing up energy and spending 
fractions on different things. Fractional, in this context isn't meant to indicate that any particular project would 
receive too few resources on purpose. We don't know how much any particular project needs, and that's the core of the 
question. Considering that you're not all in on one idea (meaning you do have more energy), how can you 
be sure that you're not failing simply due to providing too small of a fraction of your energy?

## More

As time goes on, the idea evolves, and your first fractional energy is used up. There's no money yet, but there is some 
traction; you got one customer. You decide to inject another fraction and see what happens. Voila, another customer. A 
third fraction goes in, and a fourth and a fifth. The project seems to be demanding more and more, there are some internal 
advocates, and some customer advocates as well, however, it is falling short of profitability.

## More

Time flies by and the project continues to demand energy greater than the return. You're making money but your goals aren't 
being met. Let's say you're up to 10% of your goal.

## When?

Do you believe in this project? Not as much as the entrepreneur who puts their lives into one thing (I believe in many 
things over one thing), but you believe in it; is it really just draining fractions of your energy that would be better 
put towards other projects? Is it time to increase your energy 10 fold to prove or break this project? Time to fold? 
Continue putting in fractional energy after energy?

## Decisive

I was told by a marketing person once that unless you put *enough* energy into a marketing plan, you'll never know (unless 
it was a knockout success right away) whether it could have been a knock out success if you just invested more energy. Given 
that we are only putting in fractions of energy, we must be decisive and eject promptly when we have a more appealing 
project demanding our energy, lest we sink slowly into the quicksand.
