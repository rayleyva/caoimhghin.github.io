I'm reading the 4-hour Workweek again and running through this part about doing less. At least for me it makes a
lot of sense and rings home very well.
I will do many things to avoid doing what's important or even to avoid deciding what is important to do! The reason being for fear of choosing the wrong
things or placing importance on the wrong things and then having failure follow.

<p>Here are some of the things I do instead:</p><ul>
<li>Clean everything. Mop, then vacuum then go over the floors with a cloth.</li>
<li>Reorganize my bookshelf</li>
<li>Do laundry, fold clothes, move things around in the closet</li>
<li>Walk the dog, again and again and again</li>
<li>Surf the internet</li>
<li>Read and delete emails by the hundreds</li>
<li>Pour over web site statistics for my company in an effort to discover a correlation between different numbers that will mean something to me without really looking for anything in particular</li>
<li>Wash the dog</li>
<li>Wash the dishes</li>
<li>Wipe down the furniture</li>
<li>Wash the car</li>
<li>Wipe down the car's interior</li>
<li>Watch movies or TV shows on Netflix</li>
<li>Work more after hours for my day job</li>
<li>Go running</li>
<li>Listen to music</li>
</ul><p>Some of the things that I know should be done:</p><ul>
<li>Fix the copy on the site for each product. Right now it is mostly bland and duplicated as a huge unreadable paragraph that is worthless to anyone looking to purchase</li>
<li>Create a one page marketing / purchase page, something like a pitch page to test for better conversion</li>
<li>Enhance the site to create a more comfortable, easier, better buying experience</li>
<li>Post to Facebook and Twitter twice per week</li>
<li>Setup an affiliate marketing program or work with CJ or similar company</li>
<li>Setup a wholesale program and find one good retail customer</li>
<li>Design, print and include a flyer in each order asking the customer why they purchased and to send feedback</li>
<li>Design, prototype and setup manufacturing for a new related product that I've been pondering now for months</li>
<li>Design and send an email to all customers X days after they purchase asking them why they purchased and how they like the product, how the product has affected or changed their lives</li>
</ul><p>These things I believe would help my company but I'm held back from doing partly because I find them boring, or I don't know what to do, but mostly because of feeling inadequate to get them done, or fear of doing them and then nothing happens, and I've wasted my time and money and end up failing. </p><p><i><b>My excuses for not getting these important things done is, of course, because I'm busy doing all those other things.</b></i></p><p><br></p>
