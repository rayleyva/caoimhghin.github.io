<p>Online marketing programs are made up of different types of people all marketing your product or service a little differently. Let's take a look at the top two:<br></p><div>
<ul>
<li>Customers (current customers, potential customers, and people about to buy)</li>
<li>Marketers (affiliates, partners, online marketers)</li>
</ul>
<div><b>How do we maximize our reach with both segments? Ignite a word of mouth movement and run a pay for performance marketing campaign at the same time?&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Asking the following questions will help:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Why do your customers want to talk about you?</li>
<li>When should you reach out to your customers (right after they buy or a week later)?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What should you offer them (money, gift cards)?</li>
<li>How should you reach out to your customers (on the purchase page, in email, phone, flier in their package)?</li>
</ul>
<div>Ask the same questions about your marketers, affiliates, and partners. This time notice a difference though in that these people don't naturally love your product. The incentive and the goal, while similar, is different for marketers. You're not really trying to get them to ignite a word of mouth movement, instead you're trying to get them to convert sales in a way that maximizes both your time and money and their time and money. For your professional marketers, this is more of a pay-for-performance marketing program than word of mouth.</div>
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>For your marketers then:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Approach them directly with the offer</li>
<li>Provide some creatives to get them started</li>
<li>Provide your thoughts on the best landing pages that you already have</li>
<li>Provide your marketing copy</li>
<li>Provide them with their performance stats, let them know how they are doing</li>
<li>Reach out to them often and let them get to work</li>
</ul>
<div>For your customers then:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Approach them gently, offering money up front might seem insincere&nbsp;</li>
<li>They are in it because they love your product, not necessarily to make $10</li>
<li>Personal customizations and exclusive rewards are often better than cash</li>
<li>Approach them for feedback, give them time to use the product</li>
<li>Approach them while they are surfing your site before they purchase as well</li>
</ul>
<div>With most affiliate programs out there that try to help you and automate various aspects of the process, you become very limited in what you can offer. Usually a cash reward, which suits your marketers really well, but maybe not your customers or anyone who is going to tell their close circle of friends versus thousands of potential other customers.</div>
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We found this to be the case with our current referral program on Texas Custom Holsters. We are able to offer cash rewards, so we get people signing up who are sending us traffic, however, the reach into our customer base is almost non-existent. So next steps for us is to refine our approach of working with our customers, gather their feedback and give them incentive to tell their friends about us.</div>
