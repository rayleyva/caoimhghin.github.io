<p><b>Who Referred Someone to you Who Purchased From You?</b></p><p>This is the only question that I need answered in order to run my&nbsp;<b>referral program</b>. It seems way more complicated than this whenever I think about starting a pay for performance marketing campaign, but it really isn't.</p><p>I've been trying to setup a good program for <a href="http://www.texascustomholsters.com">Texas Custom Holsters</a>&nbsp;for a long time now and as such I've evaluated several options including:</p><ul>
<li>Clickbank</li>
<li>Commission Junction</li>
<li>Share-a-sale</li>
<li>Click Meter</li>
<li>Refersion</li>
</ul><p>These <u>affiliate networks or programs don't appeal to me</u> as a small business owner for several reasons:</p><ul>
<li>
<b>$500++</b> Startup fee WTF!?!?!</li>
<li>Monthly fees plus percentage of commission paid fees!?</li>
<li>High monthly fees</li>
<li>Inaccurate or not trust worthy data source</li>
<li>Too much hassle to get started with verifying bank accounts, etc...</li>
<li>Too much effort to integrate with custom checkout processes</li>
</ul><p><b>I run a six figure company and I want a referral program that:</b><br></p><ul>
<li>Is super simple to setup (like stupid simple, as in takes 10 seconds)</li>
<li>Is super simple for my affiliates to join (as in doesn't require any new accounts, or long setup process)</li>
<li>Uses my domain name for all affiliate links</li>
<li>Fits into my business model and is built for automation</li>
<li>Doesn't break the bank</li>
</ul><p>I had to build the service that I want because it didn't exist!&nbsp;</p><p>That service is now live in a private / limited beta... as in I'm not openly advertising it yet. If you want to find out more, visit <a href="http://www.whopath.com">www.whopath.com</a>.</p><p><b>Who Path</b> promises to be the referral program service that:</p><ul>
<li>Requires no actual account signup to get started</li>
<li>Requires no actual account signup from your affiliates</li>
<li>Provides accurate data directly to your inbox and that of your affiliates</li>
<li>Is absolutely built for automation</li>
<li>Costs just one flat rate to use for each program that you setup</li>
<li>Integrates into every page of your site with a simple javascript that operates similarly to google analytics tag</li>
</ul><p><br></p>
