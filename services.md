*Need Exceptional Software Built Fast?*

Too many people’s dreams of creating a website and making it big online die before they even leave the workshop—if you
want the chance to turn your concept into a reality, then read on to discover why **there is no better time than today**.

The web has transformed the way we work.

Now you can get your web development work done at a crazily low price **offshore** and ‘sometimes’ the work you get back is excellent.

#### Sadly This Is A Rare Exception

Custom contracts are NOT cheap.

Often just getting your foot in the door is going to set you back 30k—and that is just to get started.

On top of that… the actual work of custom application development can be really difficult and require exceptional coding skills.

If you choose the wrong person – which happens regularly as there is little control over who really ends up doing your
work for you—then you will quickly sink vast amounts of time, money and effort into a project that you are told is going well…

 … until it isn’t— and you won’t even come away with a working prototype!

##### This is a painful experience and it can be fatal to your early chances of success.

## The Problems With Software Begin After<br/>The Project Is Complete

So you’ve laid out your money and you’ve got your software and everything is good…  except you come back a week later and technology has moved on…

All of a sudden your cutting edge software is a dinosaur and you’re completely on your own with it.

Your only option is to try and re-engage with your old developer and hope they future-proofed your widget,
and that they have the time or inclination to work for you again.

Or go to some other developer and pay a fortune in the hope that they can decipher the old developer’s code.

Either way you end up losing.

But it doesn’t have to be that way…

## Don’t End Up Stuck With Useless Code

The software I write is like Evolution. **Accelerated.**

All my code is:

* Clean And Simple
* Universally Understood
* Easy To Change, Upgrade And Maintain

So when technology moves on… and it will, you can be certain that any worthwhile developer can immediately see what needs to be done and enable your software to evolve at the same pace as technology.

##### Of course, the chances are you’ll just return to me!

## Take Your Idea From Concept To Money-Spinner At Lightning Speed

Not only will your work turnaround be fast… but because of the simplicity of the code I will be able to rapidly
innovate WITH YOU, and help you fill the gaps in your concept with my own long-term and deeply embedded experience
in development, design, business and entrepreneurship.

You won’t just come away with your concept as a money-spinner but as a greatly enhanced product, widget or software
that has benefited from multiple layers of expertise.

### And It Won’t Cost You 30K To Get Started

In fact, it won't cost you anything even close to that.

## Case Study: CreekRoadRanch.com

For just **$300 dollars** I moved this dinosaur website from a super crappy ancient host to a state of the art cloud server at

### *GUARANTEED: NO CONTRACT TOO SMALL*

If you have a great idea but don’t know where to start and have been put off by the HUGE costs of dealing with most
professional (and on-shore) services then relax, because as well as taking on larger contracts **I love to work on the little jobs**.

single piece of functionality for you at a time…

And regardless of contract size every single one of my clients enjoys the same level of service.
