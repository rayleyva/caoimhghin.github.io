            <h2>Case Study: CreekRoadRanch.com</h2>

            <p>
                For just **$300 dollars** I moved this dinosaur website from a super crappy ancient host to a state of
                the art cloud server at
                DigitalOcean and even provide hosting for an entire year. Within a week the new HOA manager enjoyed a
                modern content
                management system; pre-loaded with all their old information. Does the site stay up to date? Now it
                does.
            </p>

            <p>
                This teeny-tiny project included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Audit current web site pages and assets</li>
                <li>Rework web pages and update with new information</li>
                <li>Port the current data, web pages and assets into WordPress</li>
                <li>Install, Host, and Monitor A Custom WordPress Install (Included For One Year)</li>
                <li>Launch Test Site</li>
                <li>Test, Change, and Only When Ready - Go Live</li>
                <li>Comprehensive website management for one year</li>
            </ul>
