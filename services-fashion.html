            <h3>Case Study: CreekRoadRanch.com</h3>

            <p>
                For just **$300 dollars** I moved this dinosaur website from a super crappy ancient host to a state of
                the art cloud server at DigitalOcean and even provide hosting for an entire year. Within a week the new HOA manager enjoyed a
                modern content management system; pre-loaded with all their old information. Does the site stay up to date? Now it does.
            </p>

            <p>
                This teeny-tiny project included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Audit current web site pages and assets</li>
                <li>Rework web pages and update with new information</li>
                <li>Port the current data, web pages and assets into WordPress</li>
                <li>Install, Host, and Monitor A Custom WordPress Install (Included For One Year)</li>
                <li>Launch Test Site</li>
                <li>Test, Change, and Only When Ready - Go Live</li>
                <li>Comprehensive website management for one year</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                Need a couple extra updates? Fine. I'm not going to be trying to bill you in 15 minute increments for every single
                teeny tiny change that needs to be made to your site.
